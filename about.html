    <p>
      <strong>Coolstuff Cloud</strong> is a small collection of simple,
      browser-based tools — created to make everyday digital tasks easier
      and to explore the joy of web development.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every project on this site runs directly in your browser and is
      designed to work without logins, downloads, or data storage.  
      Examples include generators, converters, calculators, and other
      lightweight utilities that focus on function and clarity.
    </p>

    <p>
      The project started as a personal learning space and has grown into
      a public playground of practical ideas — from experimenting with
      JavaScript to deploying real tools on custom domains.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each subdomain (for example,
      <a href="https://password.coolstuff.cloud" target="_blank">password.coolstuff.cloud</a>)
      is an independent tool but follows the same privacy and transparency
      principles outlined here.
    </p>
